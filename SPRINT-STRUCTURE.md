# Structure of a Sprint

## Goals

This index structure is intended to accomplish the following goals

1. Organize for quick reference and discoverability.
2. Provide content in a logical structure which reflects the engineering process.
3. Extensible hierarchy to allow teams to share deep subject matter expertise.
